                <p style="font-size: 150%; color:#b48948 ">Why?</p>
                <p>Every item created in our economy often contains a tag that uniquely identifies the item and acts as
                    a means of
                    authentication between the maker and the purchaser. This tag may take several forms, ranging from a
                    basic name tag to a
                    real handwritten Certificate-of-Authenticity (COA), which is particularly prominent on premium
                    items. These tags often
                    provide information on the color, size, origin, and other aspects of the product. Authenticity is a
                    characteristic that
                    both companies and consumers consider, and justifiably so, considering the acts of forgery that
                    happens every day.
                    <br><br>
                    The United States alone seized more than $1.3 billion in counterfeit products in the fiscal year
                    2020. Over 60% of the
                    merchandise seized by CBP (Customs & Border Protection) were cosmetics and fashion-related. A
                    counterfeit cosmetic
                    product may offer serious health hazards, including skin cancer, and the colors used in low-cost
                    knockoffs can cause a
                    range of allergic reactions owing to the use of chemicals such as Benzidine. Small and growing firms
                    are
                    disproportionately harmed by these low-cost imitations.
                </p>

                <p style="font-size: 150%; color:#b48948 ">The solution?</p>
                <p>Quite simply, the Blockchain. By tokenizing critical trade goods, we can begin to eliminate these
                    unscrupulous actors. Tokenization is the
                    process of converting an asset's ownership rights into a digital token. As more businesses use this
                    new technology,
                    there will be an increased requirement for customers to verify the legitimacy of a product before
                    buying it. If a
                    product is sold with an NFT, it will always be offered alongside the NFT on the secondary market.
                    <br><br>
                    We believe that we can help be a part of this solution and we want to use our resources in the
                    development of these technologies.
                    Piksl Fashion will be the first venture of many in this direction. We hope to share more news and
                    info about this in due time.
                </p>
